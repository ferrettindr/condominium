service provided by the administrator server:
    CONDO LIST
    these servicies are synchronized on the condo list
    - insertion of a new house in the condo:
        - if not already present it is added to the condo and it is returned the condo list
        - if already present an error is returned
    - removal of a house:
        - remove the house from the condo list
    - condo list is returned to the administrator

    STATS
    Reduce the conflict between the services to a minimum
    - condo sends stats for the houses and updates them
    - administrator reads stats or aggregates them

    resolved conflicts generated from two houses entering or leaving at the same time.

    Understand how to make a mesh network works. Election and mutual exclusion algorithms. Message handling by the houses
    The house needs to have multiple threads that accomplish different tasks:
        - read user input from command line to perform boost requests or removal from the condo requests
        - calculate the local measurements usage with sliding window
        - send usage to the elected node
        - recieve messages and start a thread with the correct response:
            - adjust topology: ack mechanism when a new node comes in or a node leaves.
            - mutual exclusion: save a queue of boost requests (richard and awart)
            - election: higher node elected (watch mechanism on slides)
            - if representative: receive usage and compute condo stat and send it to the server
